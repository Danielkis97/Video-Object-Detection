BestVideoResult - Explanation

This video demonstrates the Faster R-CNN model applied to Video 2 from the MOT17 dataset, using automatic calibration (Linear Search).
Faster R-CNN was selected as the best State-of-the-Art (SoA) system after evaluating three different models—Faster R-CNN,YOLOv8, and SSD300—based on their validity, reliability, and objectivity.
Faster R-CNN achieved the highest mAP and F1-Score across various complex scenarios, particularly in this video, where it handled challenging environments like nighttime street views effectively. 
The automatic calibration ensured a strong balance between precision and recall, making it the most reliable model for accurate object detection and segmentation.
The video has been compressed to 24 MB for upload purposes, but it still maintains the key detection and segmentation performance of Faster R-CNN.
